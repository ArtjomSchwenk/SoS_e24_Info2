Using an alt account because of people trace this back to me my reelection chances might get hurt.

I (74M) am finishing up my first term as President of the United States of America. Let me tell you, 
America is an incredible country, probably one of the best countries in the whole nation. As my reelection comes 
closer and closer, my opponent Sleepy Joe has been leading in approval ratings, and I began to get worried. 
Let me tell you, I am the best at being worried. Just ask anybody in my administration, I get worried like 
no other president. Anyways, I was considering putting Sleepy Joe to sleep for good, which I think is a service 
not only to his family, but also the nation as a whole. I was going to ask my good pal Putin to borrow some of 
that poison he’s using to silence the libtards in his country. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

EDIT: I’m not Donald Trump.

EDIT 2: Stop saying I’m Donald Trump.

EDIT 3: Bitches I got the nuclear launch codes keep testing me and you can say bye bye to the Caribbean’s.

EDIT 4: Adios Bahamas.
